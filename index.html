							On October 4, 1957, the first man made satellite, Sputnik, was sent to orbit by the Soviet
							Union. A new
							frontier, outer space, had opened. While ideas about space exploration date back to at least
							the 17th
							century (1), space exploration only began to be realized in the second half of the twentieth
							century.

							From the 1950s to the 1980s, the Cold War pushed space exploration to new heights in the
							Space Race, a
							technological competition for space superiority between the US and the USSR. The Soviets
							were very
							successful, putting the first satellite in space (Sputnik, in 1957), the first person in
							space (Yuri
							Gagarin, in 1961), and creating the first space station (Salyut, in 1971). On the US side,
							its main success
							was with the Apollo program, which landed humans on the moon for the first time in 1969, and
							continued to
							land astronauts on the moon until 1972. After the end of Apollo, both the US and USSR
							pivoted towards
							developing space stations, Skylab for the US, and Mir for the USSR (1). The true end of the
							Space Race is
							unclear, but ended no later than 1991, when the USSR dissolved.
						</p>
						<p class="text textbody">
							The Apollo missions and the Saturn V rocket were followed by the Space Shuttle era, lasting
							until 2011. The
							Shuttle Era also saw the construction of the International Space Station, a cooperative
							effort from 16
							countries. The ISS has, and will continue to provide valuable scientific data for
							microgravity experiments,
							until at least 2024 (1).
						</p>
						<p class="text textbody">
							Following the end of the Shuttle Era, private space flight began to expand rapidly in the
							2010s. Private
							companies, such as SpaceX, Blue Origin, and Rocket Lab, have all grown massively,
							resupplying the ISS,
							launching NASA satellites, and even providing space tourism.

						<p class="text textbody">
							Throughout its history, space exploration has had enormous impacts on both the US and the
							world, in numerous
							fields. The exploration of space has allowed for countless scientific discoveries with
							widespread impacts.
							Just to name a few, space exploration has allowed for the discovery of the expansion of the
							universe
							(through the Hubble Space Telescope, 3), water on mars (with the Mars Reconnaissance
							Orbiter, 4), and much
							more. It has also paved the way for technological revolutions, such as the creation of GPS.
							Culturally,
							space exploration has inspired people all across the globe. Apollo 11, the Space Shuttle,
							and Mars rovers
							have become icons in today’s society. Ideas surrounding space exploration permeate
							literature, film, art,
							music, and continue to influence society. Space exploration is undoubtedly a critical part
							of today’s
							society, and will only grow in importance.

This single event marked the dawn of the Space Age, which would change the world in the coming decades. More immediately, the launch of Sputnik shocked the American public, who believed that the US held technological superiority over the Soviets after WW2. Americans were reminded of the Pearl Harbor attacks, less than 16 years prior. Sputnik marked the beginning of the space race, which has had innumerous cultural, social, and scientific effects on the US and the world.

As an African-American woman working in the south, she and other women in NASA faced racism and sexism throughout her career. However, this didn’t hold her back, and Johnson became a critical part of the US’s space program. Most famously, John Glenn, the first American to orbit Earth, asked specifically for Johnson to hand check the trajectory calculations generated by the new electronic computers. She would later be a key part of the Apollo and Space Shuttle missions. Johnson’s legacy lives on to this day, helping empower young people in STEM.

															The Apollo Guidance Computers were critical parts of the Apollo missions, responsible for the fly by wire systems in the spacecraft, along with being partially responsible for the navigation of the rocket. The computers were trailblazers in the fields of computing. Most notably, the computers were designed with integrated circuits (multiple transistors on a single chip), which were new inventions at the time. The Apollo program sparked the silicon revolution, and drove the field of computing forwards. Today, a mid level modern consumer chip, the ryzen 5 5600x, contains 4 billion transistors, a drastic change from the 17 thousand transistors on the Apollo Guidance Computer. Yet, today’s computers are only possible with the development of integrated circuits, driven in part by the Apollo missions.

The Apollo missions and NASA have inspired American media. Take Star Trek for example. The show has paid homage to American spaceflight in showing scenes from Apollo 14, the ISS, and much more. Astronaut Mae Jemison has made a cameo in a 1993 episode. Apollo 13 inspired The Martian. Culture also influences American spaceflight. Star Trek actors have aided NASA in recruiting minorities, the Space Shuttle Enterprise was inspired by Star Trek, and countless scientists, engineers, and astronauts have been inspired by space exploration in pop culture. American culture has and will continue to be deeply intertwined with spaceflight. After all, the history of American spaceflight is embodied by Star Trek’s most famous words, “To boldly go where no man has gone before”.

															Despite the success of the Apollo program, it was not without its setbacks. One such setback was the tragic disaster of Apollo 1 in 1967, where a fire in the capsule during a mission simulation killed three astronauts. The cause of the fire is unknown. However, it is known that safety flaws such as a pressurized pure oxygen environment and an inward opening hatch ultimately made the fire deadly. At the time, the Apollo program had many issues, such as poor quality control and design, along with hardware issues. As a result of the tragedy, NASA vastly improved the safety and reliability of the Apollo spacecraft, paving the way for the first successful moon landing with Apollo 11. The tragedy and its response demonstrates the resilience and perseverance of NASA and the US as a whole.

															During the Apollo 8 mission, the first mission to orbit the moon, William Anders took “Earthrise”, a photo of the Earth over the lunar horizon. Since its capture in 1968, the photo has become one of the most important photographs in history. Most importantly, it was a key factor in the environmental movement. The movement led to the creation of Earth Day 16 months after “Earthrise”, and later key laws such as the Endangered Species Act. In 1990, a similar photo was taken by Voyager 1, showing the earth as a “pale blue dot” in the vastness of space. These photographs show us Earth’s fragility and its insignificance in a practically infinite universe. Every person and every conflict in the world has taken place on this small blue marble.

Kubasov. This was the climax of the Apollo-Soyuz Test Project, the first joint space mission between the US and the Soviet Union. 
															The mission was intended to demonstrate the ability of the US and USSR to work together, reflecting the détente in relations between the two nations which developed during the Nixon administration. The two groups treated each other with hospitality, exchanging gifts, and carrying out joint experiments over a period of 2 days. The mission paved the way for future collaboration between the nations, such as the construction of the International Space Station. The mission is reflective of the ability for space exploration to unify countries.

															The Hubble Space Telescope is one of, if not the most important scientific instrument in history. While it was plagued with budget issues, delays, and a manufacturing problem, it ultimately launched on April 24, 1990, and was fully operational in 1994 after a service mission. Since then, the telescope has been used in approximately 13,000 scientific papers by 4,000 scientists. It has photographed the impact of a comet on Jupiter, discovered 4 of Pluto’s moons, dated the universe, and provided evidence of supermassive black holes, along with many others. In addition, images such as the “Pillars of Creation” have captivated the public, inspiring people across the globe.

															In 1995, the Hubble Space Telescope imaged a minute section of the sky, the size of a pinhead held at arm's length, for 10 straight days. The resulting image revolutionized our understanding of the universe. Nearly every single point of light in the image is a galaxy, in various stages of life. The 3,000 galaxies visible in the image are located over 12 billion light years away, allowing astronomers to study the early universe. Subsequent deep field images were captured, peering deeper and farther into the universe. No other image has changed our fundamental understanding of the universe to a greater extent.

															This version of the “Pale Blue Dot” photo (originally taken by Voyager 1) was taken by the Cassini space probe in 2013. The earth appears as a small blue dot on the right side of the photo, under the backdrop of Saturn’s rings. The Cassini space probe was designed to explore Saturn and its moons, and orbited Saturn from 2004 to 2017. The mission ended after the probe was plunged into Saturn’s atmosphere to prevent biological contamination on Saturn’s moons. Throughout its lifespan, the probe has created beautiful pictures of Saturn and its moons, discovered liquid water on Enceladus, a moon that shoots jets of ice into space, discovered liquid methane lakes on Titan, and landed the Huygens probe on the surface of Titan.

Beginning as an American endeavor, construction began in 1998 and reached full capacity in 2009. Sixteen nations were involved in the construction, demonstrating the power of international cooperation in space exploration. Throughout its lifespan, the ISS has provided key scientific research. For example, the station is used to research the impact of microgravity on the body in preparation for longer missions (such as to Mars), agriculture in space, climate monitoring on Earth, and much more. It has also spurred the development of a new economic sector in orbit as private companies are contracted to resupply the ISS, along with conducting research on the station. However, the future of the station is uncertain, especially as Russia has threatened to remove support following tensions between the US and Russia.

From a science perspective, the James Webb Space Telescope will be used to study the origins and evolution of the universe after successfully launching in 2021. NASA’s Dragonfly mission is slated to launch in 2027, and will explore Titan (one of Saturn’s moons) with a quadcopter in order to study the origins of life. Private rocket companies will only grow in scope, serving private citizens as well as NASA missions. On the human mission side, NASA's Artemis program aims to land Americans back on the moon for the first time since Apollo 17. NASA is also developing a manned Mars mission utilizing a variant of the SLS. However, without public and governmental support, NASA and American spaceflight will fall behind competition from countries such as China.
